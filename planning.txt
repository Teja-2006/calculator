PLANNING FOR THE MAIN FUNCTIONALITY OF THE CALCULATOR APP.

Now my plan for making the main function for my calculator app is to =>

-> Make a function that takes an array as an input.

-> Split the array using the operator symbol like (+,-,*,/ etc.) and make a new array
   ->Lets not break the array using map.
   ->lets make a array with the help of map

-> And call custom methods created to perform the desired task.
